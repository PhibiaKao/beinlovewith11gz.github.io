<div class="content">
<p>I remember the first time I saw you. You were so beautiful, and I knew right away that I had to get to know you better. We've been through so much together over the years, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. You're my best friend, my lover, and my soulmate. I love you more than anything in the world.</p>
<p>I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to grow old with you, watch our children grow up, and travel the world together. I love you more than words can say.</p>

<p>We've been together for 49days
